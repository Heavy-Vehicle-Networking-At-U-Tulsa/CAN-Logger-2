# CAN-Logger-2
Source code and documentation for the CAN Logger 2

## Purpose: 
Use as an educational tool to interface with CAN, including dual CAN channels, MCP2515 third CAN, Single Wire CAN, LIN, J1708, WIFI, LEDs, and pushed button

## Logger Device Test Programs
### LED with button: 
Test codes used to turn on three LEDs by pushing the button

### Dual CAN channels 
Test codes used to send/receive CAN message periodically on both channels CAN0 and CAN1 using FLEX CAN library. The library can be accessed here: https://github.com/Heavy-Vehicle-Networking-At-U-Tulsa/FlexCAN_Library

### MCP2515 
test codes used to send/receive CAN message periodically through third CAN channel using MCP library. The library can be accessed here: https://github.com/Heavy-Vehicle-Networking-At-U-Tulsa/NMFTA-CAN-Logger/tree/master/Arduino_Libraries_to_Install/MCP2515
